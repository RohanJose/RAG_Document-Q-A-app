RAG document Q&amp;A (groq,llama3,streamlit)

## RAG Document Q&A

### Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for Document Question Answering (Q&A) using the following key technologies:

- Groq for hardware-accelerated inferencing

- Llama 3 for large language model (LLM) generation

- Streamlit for an interactive web-based user interface

The system is designed to take user queries, retrieve relevant information from documents, and generate accurate and context-aware answers. This pipeline leverages RAG's power to combine retrieval and generation for handling large-scale unstructured data.
